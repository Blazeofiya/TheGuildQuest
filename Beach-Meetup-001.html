                <div class="article-body">
                    <p>Yesterday, I brought a bag of mandarins and my towel to the beach, unsure if anyone would actually show up to a group meetup I started on Reddit‚Äîa platform built around anonymity. In the back of my mind, I was hoping for a big crowd, but I also knew it would be tough getting people out of their comfort zones.</p>
                    
                    <p>I arrived around 5:45 p.m. and patiently waited. A pregnant woman asked for a mandarin, which I gladly gave her. It made me feel a bit better‚Äîlike not all my effort had gone to waste.</p>
                    
                    <p>Then, out of nowhere, our first crew member, we'll call Zoro üó°Ô∏è, showed up. We started with some light introductions. There's always that initial awkwardness when meeting someone new, but that's part of the process. Realizing it was just going to be the two of us, I suggested we walk along the beach.</p>
                    
                    <p>It felt great to walk and talk, and soon we noticed a lot of trash mixed in with the seaweed. So we started picking it up. By the end of the mile-long stretch, we had nearly a bucket full of trash and a great conversation‚Äîcovering sustainability, community building, and the struggles people face with media addiction and overconsumption.</p>
                    
                    <p>On the way back, a kind lady saw us picking up trash and stopped to chat so happy to see what we were doing.</p>
                    
                    <p>At first, I was a little disappointed that more people didn't show up. But having Zoro to talk with and bounce ideas off really helped. And the people we met along the way added to the experience‚Äîit all felt genuine.</p>
                    
                    <p>Doing something as simple as picking up a few loose bags and bottles on the beach felt really good. And I realize now‚Äîthis is just the beginning. I started with an idea and myself, and now we're two. There's more to come.</p>
                    
                    <p>I'm more motivated than ever to keep going and see the impact this can have. Looking forward to the next one. Stay tuned!</p>
                    
                    <p><strong>P.S.</strong> ‚Äì Added a selfie of us. Kept it Ghiblified to stay focused on the mission, not looks or social media. I get that visuals help people feel more at ease about meeting up, so hopefully it does just that.</p>
